WALMART ANALYSIS USING SQL

This repository contains a SQL-based analysis of Walmart sales data. The SQL scripts perform a range of data transformations and queries to explore key metrics such as the most popular product lines, customer demographics, payment methods, and monthly sales trends. The analysis provides insights into customer behavior and sales performance, helping to identify high-performing categories and trends over time. This project is a valuable resource for understanding data-driven decision-making in retail analytics
